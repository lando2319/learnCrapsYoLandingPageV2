Before Come Bet Has Traveled

- Wins on Seven or Eleven
- Loses on Two, Three, or Twelve
- Any other number and bet travels to number rolled.

Once a Come Bet has traveled to a number you have the option of adding Odds. Odds pay "True Odds".

- Bet on 6 or 8 Odds pay 5 for every 6
- Bet on 5 or 9 Odds pay 2 for every 3
- Bet on 4 or 10 Odds pay 1 for every 2
