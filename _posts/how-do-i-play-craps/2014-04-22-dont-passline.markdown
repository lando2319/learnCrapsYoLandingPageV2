During the Come Out Roll, the Don't Pass Line, wins on Two or Three, Loses on Seven, or Eleven, Twelve is a Push. Any other number becomes the Point.

Once a Point is established, rolling the Point loses, rolling Seven wins.

With a Point is established you have the option of adding a Lay against the Don't Pass Line. This is additional action against the Point, which pays "True Odds".

- Point is 6 or 8 Odds pay 5 for every 6
- Point is 5 or 9 Odds pay 2 for every 3
- Point is 4 or 10 Odds pay 1 for every 2

With a Point established, rolling the Point loses, rolling Seven wins.
