Before Don't Come Bet Has Traveled

- Wins on Two or Three
- Loses on Seven, or Eleven
- Push on Twelve
- Any other number and bet travels to number rolled.

Once a Don't Come Bet has traveled to a number you have the option of adding a Lay. Lay Bet pays "True Odds".

- Bet on 6 or 8 Odds pay 6 for every 5
- Bet on 5 or 9 Odds pay 3 for every 2
- Bet on 4 or 10 Odds pay 2 for every 1
