Once a Point is established you have the option of add Odds behind the Passline. This is additional action on the Point, which pays "True Odds".

- Point is 6 or 8 Odds pay 6 for every 5
- Point is 5 or 9 Odds pay 3 for every 2
- Point is 4 or 10 Odds pay 2 for every 1

With a Point established, rolling the Point wins, rolling Seven loses.
