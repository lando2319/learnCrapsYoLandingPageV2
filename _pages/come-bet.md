Before Come Bet Has Traveled

- Wins on Seven or Eleven
- Loses on Two, Three, or Twelve
- Any other number and bet travels to number rolled.

Once a Come Bet has traveled to a number you have the option of adding Odds. Odds pay "True Odds".

- Odds on Six or Eight pay 6 for every 5
- Odds on Five or Nine pay 3 for every 2
- Odds on Four or Ten pay 2 for every 1 (Double)
